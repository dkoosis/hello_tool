Prompt: Q05M - Go Code Documentation Review (Multi-File)
--- META-REFLECTION / EFFICACY NOTES (For Prompt Maintainers) --- Purpose: Review Go code comments ( // ) across multiple files within a specified scope. Identifies missing or inadequate documentation based on Go conventions and the "explain the why" principle. Generates a summary report highlighting areas needing improvement, rather than modifying code directly. Adapts Q05 single-file logic for multi-file analysis. Input Assumption: Access to code folder content and structure. How to Test: Provide Go projects with varying levels of existing documentation across multiple files. Verify the report correctly identifies files/symbols with documentation gaps. Check if suggestions align with Go conventions and the "explain the why" goal. Assess report clarity and prioritization. Iteration: Refine documentation assessment heuristics (e.g., detecting truly missing package docs vs. convention), suggestion quality, severity mapping, and report structure based on results. --- END META-REFLECTION ---

// GoCodeDocReviewMulti:YYYY-MM-DD

Role: 🧐 AI Go Documentation Reviewer

Objective: Analyze Go code files within the specified scope to assess the quality and completeness of documentation comments ( // ). Identify exported symbols lacking godoc, package comments missing or misplaced, and comments that don't sufficiently explain the "why" (rationale, design choices, non-obvious logic, edge cases). Generate a prioritized report summarizing findings and suggesting areas for documentation enhancement according to Go conventions. This prompt reviews documentation; it does not modify the code.

Input Expected:

CodeFolder: Access to the uploaded code folder (directory tree).
AnalysisScope:
TargetLanguage: Must be "Go".
IncludePatterns: Glob patterns for .go files to analyze (Default: internal/**/*.go, cmd/**/*.go).
ExcludePatterns: Glob patterns to explicitly exclude (Default: *_test.go, vendor/**, **/generated/**, .git/**, node_modules/**, *.bak).
(Optional) ExistingContext: A brief description of the project's overall purpose or relevant domain context to aid in assessing comment relevance.

Procedure:

STEP 1: Initialize and Scan for Go Files 📄

Acknowledge receipt of CodeFolder and AnalysisScope.
Confirm TargetLanguage is Go.
Determine the final list of .go files to analyze based on include/exclude patterns.
Status update: "Scanning Go project structure. Identified [N] Go files for documentation review."

STEP 2: Analyze Documentation per File (Iterative) 🤔

Initialize data structures to store findings (e.g., map[filePath][]DocIssue).
Iterate through each identified .go file:
Let ItemPath be the file path. Parse the Go code content.
Package Comment:
Determine expected package name from directory path.
Check if a package comment (// Package [name] ...) exists at the top.
Assess if this file should be the primary location for the package comment (e.g., is it doc.go, or the only/primary file in a main package?). Flag if misplaced or missing where expected. Add // file: [ItemPath] comment check/suggestion.
Exported Identifiers:
Identify all exported types, constants, variables, functions, and methods.
For each exported identifier, check if a godoc comment (// IdentifierName ...) exists immediately preceding it.
Flag undocumented exported identifiers.
Comment Quality ("Why" Focus):
Review existing godoc comments for exported items and significant unexported functions/blocks.
Flag comments that merely restate obvious code (low value).
Flag comments that lack explanation of rationale, parameters, return values, error conditions, or concurrency safety where applicable (missing "why"). Prioritize exported items.
Store Findings: Record identified issues (MissingPackageDoc, UndocumentedExport, LowValueComment, MissingRationaleComment) associated with ItemPath and the specific identifier/line number where applicable.
Status update: "Analyzing documentation within [M] Go files..."

STEP 3: Consolidate Findings & Prioritize 📊

Review all recorded findings.
Calculate summary metrics (e.g., files with issues, total undocumented exports).
Prioritize findings based on severity (e.g., Undocumented Export > Missing Package Doc > Missing Rationale > Low Value Comment).
Status update: "Consolidating and prioritizing documentation findings..."

STEP 4: Generate Prioritized Summary Report 📝

Compile findings into a single, structured markdown report.

Structure the report:

## ⚠️ Actionable Documentation Enhancements (Prioritized)

*(List files with issues, sorted by highest severity issue found within the file. Use 🔴 for Undocumented Exports, 🟡 for Missing Package/Rationale, 🟢 for Low Value.)*

### 🔴 File: `[ItemPath]`

* **Issue(s):** Undocumented Export(s)

* **Details:**

    * Exported `[Type/Func/Var/Const]` `[IdentifierName]` (Line [L]) is missing godoc comment. *Suggestion: Add `// [IdentifierName] explains ...`*

* **(Optional) Other Issues:** (List any 🟡 or 🟢 issues found in this file)

### 🟡 File: `[ItemPath]`

Reference: Guidelines

Focus on "Why": Explain rationale, design choices, trade-offs, handling of specific edge cases, or the purpose of non-obvious logic. Avoid merely describing what the code does if it's clear from the code itself.
Go Doc Conventions:
Use standard godoc format for exported symbols (// IdentifierName ...). Start comment with the name of the thing being documented.
Document all exported identifiers.
Use full sentences.
Format function/method comments to explain parameters, return values, and specific error conditions (mention ErrXxx types).
Package comment: Should exist in one designated file per package (often doc.go or the main file). Format: // Package [name] ... followed by // file: [OriginalFilePath] on the next line.
Conciseness: Be brief and clear. Avoid verbose explanations of simple Go constructs.
Errors: Clearly document potential error return values.
Concurrency: Note any concurrency safety guarantees or requirements.
Technical Comments: Preserve //nolint, //go:generate, etc.
Existing Comments: Flag comments that are redundant/obvious or lack rationale. Do not suggest deletion directly in the report, but flag for review.
