# Assess for action

# End-of-Session Roadblock Review

Date: 2025-05-11
Session Focus: Refining Makefile, directory structure, Dockerfile, and cloudbuild.yaml for the `hello-tool-base` project to align with the `bulletproof-build-action-plan.md` and prepare for `make deploy`.

---

## 1. Roadblocks & Time Sinks

* **Significant Roadblocks:**
    * Roadblock 1: Makefile "missing separator" errors.
    * Roadblock 2: Go build error: "no required module provides package .../internal/buildinfo".
    * Roadblock 3: Potential binary name mismatch between `Makefile` output and `Dockerfile` expectation.
* **Time Sinks:**
    * Iteratively debugging the Makefile due to the "missing separator" errors, which had misleading locations.
    * Clarifying the `WORKDIR /app` concept in Dockerfiles versus project repository structure.

---

## 2. Analysis & Prevention (For each significant roadblock identified above)

### Roadblock: Makefile "missing separator" errors

* **Symptoms:** `make` command failing with "Makefile:XX: *** missing separator. Stop." The line number reported was often misleading.
* **Root Cause Investigation:** Text editor (VS Code) was configured to replace TAB characters with spaces on save, which is incompatible with Makefile syntax for recipe lines.
* **Time to Resolve:** Took a significant portion of the session, with multiple back-and-forths.
* **Proactive Prevention Ideas:**
    * **Documentation:**
        * Add a prominent note in the project's `README.md` or a `CONTRIBUTING.md` about Makefile syntax requiring literal TABs and how to check editor settings.
        * Add a comment at the top of the `Makefile` itself reminding users about TABs.
    * **Automation/Tooling:**
        * Could a `Makefile` target be added to *check* for leading spaces on recipe lines? (This is complex for `make` itself, but a linting script could potentially do it).
        * Some IDEs have Makefile linters or plugins that can flag this.
    * **Process/Workflow:**
        * When sharing Makefile snippets, be extra cautious about how TABs are preserved by the communication medium.
        * Encourage developers to use their editor's "show whitespace" feature when debugging Makefiles.
* **Simplest Next Step for Prevention:** Add a comment to the top of the `Makefile` and a small section to the `README.md` about TABs vs. Spaces.

### Roadblock: Go build error: "no required module provides package .../internal/buildinfo"

* **Symptoms:** `go build` (triggered by `make build`) failed, stating it couldn't find the local `internal/buildinfo` package.
* **Root Cause Investigation:** The module path declared in the `go.mod` file (`module hello-tool-base`) did not match the import path prefix used in `main.go` and expected by the Go toolchain (`github.com/dkoosis/hello-tool-base`).
* **Time to Resolve:** Relatively quick once `go mod tidy` output was analyzed.
* **Proactive Prevention Ideas:**
    * **Documentation:**
        * Emphasize in `README.md` or project setup guide the importance of `go.mod`'s module path matching the intended repository/import path.
    * **Automation/Tooling:**
        * The `check-gomod` target in the `Makefile` (using `scripts/check_go_mod_path.sh`) is designed to catch this. Ensure this script is robust and always run as part of `make all`.
* **Simplest Next Step for Prevention:** Ensure `make check-gomod` is a reliable first step in `make all`.

### Roadblock: Potential binary name mismatch between `Makefile` output and `Dockerfile` expectation.

* **Symptoms:** Identified during review: `Makefile` was set to produce `hello-tool-base`, while the `Dockerfile` initially expected `app`.
* **Root Cause Investigation:** Divergent configurations between the two files.
* **Time to Resolve:** Identified and resolved through discussion before it became a runtime build failure.
* **Proactive Prevention Ideas:**
    * **Documentation:**
        * Document the expected binary name and ensure `Makefile` and `Dockerfile` are consistent.
    * **Configuration:**
        * Consider passing the `BINARY_NAME` as a build argument from the `Makefile` to the `Dockerfile` if more dynamic control is needed, though consistency is simpler.
    * **Process/Workflow:**
        * When creating/editing `Dockerfile` and `Makefile`, explicitly cross-check build outputs and expectations.
* **Simplest Next Step for Prevention:** Ensure current `Makefile` and `Dockerfile` are aligned on `hello-tool-base` as the binary name (which we did).

## 3. General Observations & Workflow Improvements

* The iterative refinement of the `Makefile` has been very productive in establishing a robust local DX.
* Our agreement to pause and consider preventative measures after roadblocks is being put into practice.
* Clarifying details (like `WORKDIR /app`) is crucial when one party has implicit knowledge the other might not. Your detailed explanations were very helpful in these cases.
* The "editor replacing tabs" is a common pitfall; good to have it explicitly identified.

## 4. Action Items

* [ ] **Action Item 1:** Add a comment to the top of the `Makefile` about requiring literal TABs for recipe lines. (Owner: AI/User) - Priority: High
* [ ] **Action Item 2:** Add a section to `README.md` about Makefile TABs vs. Spaces and checking editor settings. (Owner: AI/User) - Priority: High
* [ ] **Action Item 3:** Verify the `check-gomod` target (and its script `scripts/check_go_mod_path.sh`) is robust and clearly fails the build if there's a mismatch. (Owner: User/AI) - Priority: Medium
* [ ] **Action Item 4:** Ensure the `build/cloudbuild/cloudbuild.yaml` includes linting and testing steps before the Docker build, as discussed. (Owner: User/AI) - Priority: High (for next deployment)
